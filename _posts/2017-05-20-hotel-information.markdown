Guests are welcome to stay anywhere, however we have reserved a block of 20 rooms at both [The Staybridge Suites (Chattanooga Downtown Convention Center)](https://www.ihg.com/staybridge/hotels/us/en/chattanooga/chacs/hoteldetail) and at the [Chattanooga Choo Choo Hotel](http://www.choochoo.com).

The block reservations are for Friday and Saturday. Those guests that are arriving on Thursday may still be able to get a room at either hotel for that day, but we were unable to hold rooms before Friday.

We have read in reviews that the Choo Choo is fun, but a little old-feeling. We chose it because it is within walking distance from The Church On Main. The Staybridge Suites Convention Center is a little farther from the venue (about a 4 minute drive), but seems to offer newer rooms than the Choo Choo, according to the reviews.

If you'd like to reserve at either of these hotels, you'll have to call them to get the group rate. The blocks will be released to the general public on September 1 for Staybridge and  September 9 for the Choo Choo.
